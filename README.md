# Robot open-Ended Autonomous Learning Starter Kit

Instructions to make submissions to the [Robot open-Ended Autonomous Learning](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2019-robot-open-ended-autonomous-learning).

Participants will have to submit their controllers, with packaging specifications, and the evaluator will automatically build a docker image and execute their controllers in two phases an Intrinsic Phase and an Extrinsic Phase.

In the first round of the competition, the Intrinsic Phase will be skipped.

### Dependencies 

- **Anaconda** (By following instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)) At least version `4.5.11` is required to correctly populate `environment.yml`.
- **real-robots** [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/real-robots/)

### Setup

* Clone the repository 

```
git clone git@github.com:AIcrowd/neurips_goal_real_robots_starter_kit.git
cd neurips_goal_real_robots_starter_kit
```

* Create a conda environment from the provided `environment.yml`

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

* Activate the conda environment and install your code specific dependencies

```sh
conda activate real_robots
# If say you want to install PyTorch
# conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
#
# or you can even use pip to install any additional packages
# for example : 
# pip install -U real-robots
# which updates the real-robots package to the latest version
```

### Test Submission Locally

* First lets download a sample `goals.npy.npz` file by doing : 
```
wget https://aicrowd-production.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/misc/REAL-Robots/goals.npy.npz -O data/goals.npy.npz
```
* test locally 
```
python local_evaluation.py
```

* (optional) build docker image locally and run docker container

```
pip install -U aicrowd-repo2docker
# This also expects that you have Docker installed

./debug.sh
```

# How do I specify my software runtime ?

The software runtime is specified by exporting your `conda` env to the root
of your repository by doing :

```
# The included environment.yml is generated by the command below, and you do not need to run it again
# if you did not add any custom dependencies

conda env export --no-build > environment.yml

# Note the `--no-build` flag, which is important if you want your anaconda env to be replicable across all
```

This `environment.yml` file will be used to recreate the `conda environment` inside the Docker container.
This repository includes an example `environment.yml`

You can specify your software environment by using all the [available configuration options of repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html). (But please remember to use [aicrowd-repo2docker](https://pypi.org/project/aicrowd-repo2docker/) to have GPU support)


# What should my code structure be like ?

Please follow the structure documented in the included [run.py](https://github.com/AIcrowd/flatland-challenge-starter-kit/blob/master/run.py) to adapt
your already existing code to the required structure for this round.

## Important Concepts

### Repository Structure

- `aicrowd.json`
  Each repository should have a `aicrowd.json` with the following content :

```json
{
  "challenge_id": "goal_real_robots_challenge_2019",
  "grader_id": "goal_real_robots_challenge_2019",
  "authors": ["mohanty"],
  "description": "Robot open-Ended Autonomous Learning (REAL) Challenge.",
  "license" : "MIT",
  "debug": true
}
```

This is used to map your submission to the said challenge, so please remember to use the correct `challenge_id` and `grader_id` as specified above.

If you set `debug` to `true`, then the evaluation will run on a separate set of 20 environments, and the logs from your submitted code (if it fails), will be made available to you to help you debug.
**NOTE** : **IMPORTANT** : By default we have set `debug:false`, so when you have done the basic integration testing of your code, and are ready to make a final submission, please do make sure to set `debug` to `true` in `aicrowd.json`.

- `my_controller.py`
  The task is to implement your own controller my following the template provided in `my_controller.py`

## Submission

To make a submission, you will have to create a private repository on [https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/).

You will have to add your SSH Keys to your GitLab account by following the instructions [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html).
If you do not have SSH Keys, you will first need to [generate one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair).

Then you can create a submission by making a _tag push_ to your repository on [https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/).
**Any tag push (where the tag name begins with "submission-") to your private repository is considered as a submission**  
Then you can add the correct git remote, and finally submit by doing :

```
cd neurips_goal_real_robots_starter_kit
# Add AIcrowd git remote endpoint
git remote add aicrowd git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/neurips_goal_real_robots_starter_kit.git
git push aicrowd master

# Create a tag for your submission and push
git tag -am "submission-v0.1" submission-v0.1
git push aicrowd master
git push aicrowd submission-v0.1

# Note : If the contents of your repository (latest commit hash) does not change,
# then pushing a new tag will **not** trigger a new evaluation.
```

You now should be able to see the details of your submission at :
[gitlab.aicrowd.com//<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/neurips_goal_real_robots_starter_kit/issues](gitlab.aicrowd.com//<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/neurips_goal_real_robots_starter_kit/issues)

**NOTE**: Remember to update your username in the link above :wink:

In the link above, you should start seeing something like this take shape (the whole evaluation can take a bit of time, so please be a bit patient too :wink: ) :

**TODO** : Add screenshot

**Best of Luck** :tada: :tada:
